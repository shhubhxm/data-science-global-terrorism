# Iris_dataset
In the given dataset  we have to find the number of optimum clusters are required baed on given features like SepalLength ,SepalWidth ,PetalLength ,PetalWidth 
Do for finding the optimum number of clusters we used Elbow methods 
While processing Elbow method we find that the optimum number of clusters would be 3
After that we had applied Kmeans Clustering algorithm 
Atlast we have to visualise our clutsers using matplotlib library 

Another method is Heirarchical Clustering 
in which we find optimum number of clusters by using dendograms ,then we useHierrachical algorithm 
atlast we again visualise our clusters by matplotliv library
